GitHub Copilot can be a great coding partner if you guide it right. This guide will teach you some strategies to make AI work for you and not against you.


## The Strategy: Ask First, Then Do

The most effective approach to using Copilot is to **ask first, then do**. Don't just start coding and hope Copilot guesses what you want.

1. **Ask first, then do** â€” e.g.:

   ```text
   // Prompt:
   I want to split this functionality out of this component.
   Give me options, explain pros/cons, and recommend the best approach for readability and performance.
   ```

2. **Provide context** - Explain what you're trying to achieve
3. **Be specific** - Don't leave room for interpretation
4. **Iterate** - Refine your prompts based on results

## The 'Let's make a plan' strategy

```text
// Prompt:
Let's make a plan for this project.
```

This strategy allows you to get started with Copilot quickly and easily.
