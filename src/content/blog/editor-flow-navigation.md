## Manage Tabs Like a Pro

Efficient tab management is crucial for maintaining focus and productivity.

### Tab Management Shortcuts

```text
Ctrl + Tab / Ctrl + Shift + Tab  Move between open editors
Cmd + W                         Close tab
Cmd + shift + W                Close all tabs
Cmd + Shift + O                 Close OTHER tabs
Cmd + Shift + T                 Reopen closed tab (Same as chrome browser)
```


## Create Files Quickly

```

VSCode will auto-create missing folders for you.

### File Creation Workflow

1. **Use `Cmd + Shift + E`** - Open explorer
2. **Use `Cmd + N`** - Create new file
3. **Type full path including type extension** - Include all parent directories


## Navigation Patterns
3 ways of navigating to a file:

### The Explorer-First Pattern

1. **Start with Explorer** - `Cmd + Shift + E`
2. **Navigate to folder** - Use arrow keys
3. **Create/open files** - Use `Cmd + N` or `Enter`
4. **Return to code** - `Cmd + ``

### The Search-First Pattern

1. **Quick Open** - `Cmd + P`
2. **Type filename** - Fuzzy search
3. **Open file** - `Enter`
4. **Navigate within** - Use symbol navigation

### The Terminal-First Pattern

1. **Open Terminal** - `Ctrl + `` 
2. **Navigate directory** - Use `cd` commands
3. **Create files** - Use `touch` or `mkdir`
4. **Open in VSCode** - Use `code .` or `code filename`
