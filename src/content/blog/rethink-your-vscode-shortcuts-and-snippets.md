**Talk:** Boosting Productivity: Shortcut your coding

---

Mastering VSCode shortcuts is about building habits, not memorizing keys. The secret to productivity is muscle memory — the ability to perform actions without conscious thought. This guide will help you build that muscle memory and transform your VSCode workflow from chaotic clicking to surgical precision.

> 🧠 **Key Principle:** Build muscle memory by associating shortcuts with actions, not key patterns.

---

## Think in Actions, Not Keys

The most important mindset shift: think about what you want to **do**, not what keys to press and create intuitive mappings based on actions. 

```json
cmd + f # "F"ind in file
cmd + s # "S"ave file
cmd + b # Toggle Side"B"ar
cmd + l # "L"ine (Go to Line)
```

## Same Shortcut, Same Action

No matter the context, we don’t have infinite memory 😝 — so why not make shortcuts easier to remember?

> 💡 Tip: Align your shortcuts in VS Code, your terminal, and your browser.
> You’ll reduce cognitive load and keep your workflow consistent everywhere.

Keep the same shortcut for the same action, across all your tools.
When your muscle memory aligns between apps, everything becomes faster and more natural.

Here's an example setup:

**Cross-Application Shortcuts:**
- `Ctrl + Tab` - Switch to next tab (Editor / Browser / Terminal)
- `Cmd + W` - Close tab (Browser / Terminal / Finder)
- `Cmd + Shift + T` - Reopen last closed tab (Browser / Editor)
- `Cmd + N` - New file (Editor / Explorer / Terminal)
- `Cmd + T` - New tab (Editor / Browser)

## Think in Super-Shortcuts

Once you’ve aligned your basic shortcuts, take it one step further —  
**create “super-shortcuts.”**  
Use the same key pattern with an added modifier (like `Shift`) to perform a **related, more powerful action**.

| Shortcut | Action | Super-Shortcut | Super-Action |
|-----------|---------|----------------|---------------|
| `cmd + w` | Close tab | `cmd + shift + w` | Close all tabs |
| `cmd + b` | Go to next bookmark | `cmd + shift + b` | Open bookmarks panel |
| `cmd + t` | New tab | `cmd + shift + t` | Reopen last closed tab |

> 💡 **Tip:** Think of these as *shortcut hierarchies*.  
> The base key combo does something small; add `Shift`, and it scales up the action.  
> Your muscle memory will thank you later.

## Quick Tip: Leave Your Comfort Zone

Try switching your keyboard and mouse position for a day.  
It's a fun brain hack that forces you to rely more on keyboard commands.

## Wrap Up

Mastering VSCode shortcuts is about building habits, not memorizing keys. Focus on:

- **Consistency** - Use the same shortcuts every day
- **Gradual improvement** - Add one new shortcut per week
- **Context awareness** - Different shortcuts for different situations
- **Practice regularly** - Muscle memory requires repetition

> 🚀 **The goal:** Stop thinking about keys and start thinking about actions.
