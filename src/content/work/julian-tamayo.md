With over 15 years of experience in the field of endocrinology, this dedicated professional believes in an integrated approach that connects emotions and chronic diseases. Working as part of a multidisciplinary team, their mission is to guide patients towards better health and habits. Their practice focuses on personalized care, involving patients' families and environments, while staying at the forefront of medical advancements through continuous education, teaching, and conference participation. Specializing in diabetes, cardiovascular risk, and metabolic-hormonal disorders, their expertise ensures comprehensive care.

I developed their website using Next.js for fast performance and scalability, with Sanity as a CMS for easy content management. To streamline appointment booking, I integrated Calendly, offering patients a seamless scheduling experience.
