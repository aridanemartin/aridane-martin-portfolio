### Escola Port

Escola Port is Barcelonaâ€™s premier nautical school, offering the best online platform for nautical courses. With a fleet of their own vessels, they provide both theory and practical sessions in one place, ensuring flexibility and weekly availability. Their highly trained instructors, high pass rates, and exclusive benefits for alumni make Escola Port the most recognized nautical institution in the city.

For Escola Port, I developed a web application to manage sailing sessions and certification processes. The frontend was built with React, ensuring a smooth user experience, while the backend, powered by Node.js, connected seamlessly with the port's systems through SAP technologies.
