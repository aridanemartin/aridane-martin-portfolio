> Roshni - Expert Nutritionist-Dietitian Focused on Digestive Health

With over 10 years of experience as a nutritionist-dietitian in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Roshni has dedicated her career to personalized nutrition, recognizing the significant impact tailored dietary habits have on individual health. She studied Human Nutrition and Dietetics at the Complutense University of Madrid, specializing in Hospital Nutrition. Her passion for digestive health led her to further education at CINUSA and to complete a Masterâ€™s in Microbiota at CEU Cardenal Herrera University, focusing on the role of gut health in chronic diseases.

Her website was developed using React for a dynamic, responsive experience, with Sass for optimized styling and design.
